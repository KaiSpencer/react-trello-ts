# Quickstart

Let's discover **react-trello-ts in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **installing react-trello-ts**.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>

```
npm install KaiSpencer/react-trello-ts
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```
yarn add KaiSpencer/react-trello-ts
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">

```
pnpm install KaiSpencer/react-trello-ts
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Usage

The `Board` component takes a prop called `data` that contains all the details related to rendering the board. A sample data json is given here to illustrate the contract:

```javascript
const data = {
  lanes: [
    {
      id: "lane1",
      title: "Planned Tasks",
      label: "2/2",
      cards: [
        {
          id: "Card1",
          title: "Write Blog",
          description: "Can AI make memes",
          label: "30 mins",
          draggable: false,
        },
        {
          id: "Card2",
          title: "Pay Rent",
          description: "Transfer via NEFT",
          label: "5 mins",
          metadata: { sha: "be312a1" },
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      id: "lane2",
      title: "Completed",
      label: "0/0",
      cards: [],
    },
  ],
};
```

`draggable` property of Card object is `true` by default.

The data is passed to the board component and that's it.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import Board from "react-trello-ts";

export default function App() {
  return <Board data={data} />;
}
```
